sctool is a Starcraft: Remastered replay analyzer library and CLI tool built with 4 main use cases:

1. enabling Data Science research
2. organising replay directories
3. learning by analyzing and tinkering with pro gamer replays' data
4. improving one's skill by discovering strengths and weaknesses on one's past games

## Status

sctool is NOT ready for mainstream use. Help beta-testing is appreciated.

## Installation

Please visit the releases page (TODO: not yet available) and download the right binary for your operating system.

## Installation for Go devs

```
$ go get -u github.com/marianogappa/sctool
$ sctool -help
```

## Summary

- sctool allows you to analyze a replay, list of replays or directory (recursive) of replays with a number of "analyzers". An example analyzer is: `--matchup-is 1v1`.

- All analyzers that return true/false results are also available as "filters" and "filter-nots". For example, `--filter--matchup-is 1v1` will only match replays with only 2 players on 2 separate teams (i.e. 1v1 games), and `--filter-not--matchup-is 1v1` will only match replays that contain 3 or more players.

- sctool further allows you to copy all replays that matched your filter criteria to a given folder. This should enable you to organise a replay folder by whatever supported criteria you want, e.g. UMS games, 1v1 games, TvZ games, games on a particular map, etc.

- sctool's output is CSV by default, making it ideal for streamlining into a Data Science research project, but it can also return JSON, which is handy to compose with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and then possibly into [chart](https://github.com/marianogappa/chart) for charting.

- Thanks to DateTime analyzers and different kinds of filtering and segmentation, sctool can track your progress: for example, you can see your APM improvement on 1v1 games on this season's maps for the matchup you're having difficulties with.

## Building on top of the analyzer library

If rather than creating a CSV/JSON you're looking to access the replay analysing results programatically, don't use
the sctool; instead, import the sctool/analyzer library in your go code. Refer to [main.go](main.go) as an example
use and to the [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/marianogappa/sctool/analyzer#Analyzer) as reference.

sctool is only possible thanks to the amazing effort by [Andr√°s Belicza](https://github.com/icza) who built the [screp](https://github.com/icza/screp) library that sctool is built on top of.
